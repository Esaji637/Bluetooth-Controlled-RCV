# Bluetooth-Controlled RCV (Remotely Controlled Vehicle)

This project presents a Bluetooth-controlled robotic vehicle (RCV) built using a Raspberry Pi. The RCV is capable of receiving directional commands via a custom MIT App Inventor mobile application, and it features live video streaming and image capture using a Raspberry Pi camera module. The goal was to create a reliable, responsive, and portable RCV suitable for short-range applications, with a focus on modular design and future extensibility.

The system integrates GPIO-based motor control via L298N motor driver boards, Bluetooth communication for wireless command input, and real-time camera feedback. The project aims to serve as a foundation for future development in remote-controlled systems operating in hazardous or constrained environments.

## SSH Access via VS Code

You can write and test code on the Raspberry Pi remotely using Visual Studio Code with SSH.

### Steps:

1. **Enable SSH on the Raspberry Pi**  
   Open a terminal on the Pi and run:
   ```bash
   sudo raspi-config
   
2. **Navigate to**
Interface Options > SSH > Enable
Install "Remote - SSH" extension in VS Code

3. Open VS Code on your computer.
Go to the Extensions tab (or press Ctrl+Shift+X).
Search for and install: Remote - SSH by Microsoft.

4. Connect to the Raspberry Pi
Press Ctrl+Shift+P and type:
makefile
Copy
Edit
Remote-SSH: Connect to Host...
Enter your Pi's IP address in the format:
**pi@192.168.x.x**
When prompted, enter the password for your Pi (default is raspberry if not changed).

5. Start coding remotely!
VS Code will open a new window connected to your Pi. You can now write, edit, and run code on the Raspberry Pi as if it were a local project.



**How to Run the Code (Simple Walkthrough)**
Follow these steps to get the project up and running:
1. **Connect all hardware**: Make sure your motors, motor drivers, Raspberry Pi, camera, and power supplies are properly wired.
2. **Power up the Pi**: Boot into Raspberry Pi OS.
3. **Open the terminal** and navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Bluetooth-Controlled-RCV
4. **Run the main script** which is below
python3 "Proper final code.py"

**Technical Details**
Motor control is handled using PWM signals sent via the Raspberry Piâ€™s GPIO pins. The L298N drivers interpret those signals to control motor speed and direction.

Bluetooth communication uses the **pybluez** library, which allows the Pi to act as a Bluetooth server, listening for single-character commands from the app.

Camera functionality uses the **picamera2** and **OpenCV** libraries for image capture and **MJPEG** streaming.

Latency measurements were gathered using stopwatch-based testing. Motion command latency averaged ~130â€“140â€¯ms, while camera-related commands were slightly higher (~160â€“180â€¯ms).

Power system was designed to supply approximately 6.5â€“7â€¯W during peak use, divided between the motors and Raspberry Pi.

No complex equations were used, but digital signal timings (e.g., PWM duty cycles) were tuned manually for motor behaviour.

**Known Issues and Future Improvements**
Bluetooth range is limited (~10â€“15â€¯m indoors). Replacing it with Wi-Fi would allow more flexible control and longer range.

Camera quality drops in low light, resulting in blur or lower FPS.

No autonomous functionality yet â€” adding AI or obstacle detection with A* pathfinding would improve navigation.

App is only available for Android â€” future work could involve converting to a web-based control interface.

No feedback from sensors â€” adding IR, ultrasonic, or GPS modules could enhance RCV awareness and autonomy.

Chassis is basic â€” a waterproof or shock-resistant enclosure could make the buggy suitable for real-world harsh environments.
